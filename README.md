## Time Tracker
Time tracker is a simple Python app that allows you to track the time you spend on different tasks. It uses a CSV file to store task data, and provides a web-based interface built with Streamlit for starting and stopping tasks, as well as generating time reports.

## Installation
To install time tracker, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can then install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also refer to the official Streamlit documentation for more detailed installation instructions: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started.

## Usage
After installing the required dependencies, you can run the time tracker app using the following command:

```
streamlit run .\time_tracker.py
```

Task data will be stored inside a CSV file which will be located in the same directory.
